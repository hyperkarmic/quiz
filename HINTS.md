# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. This homework is asking other students like yourself, what have you learnt so far that you could ask another student?

1. We've been working a lot with dynamically getting an element, and then adding elements and their related styling to different components. This is going to be super important. Likewise we're going to need to use the event listeners for when we interact with the quiz.

1. Storing all of these questions and answers are going to require you to use all the javascript knowledge you honed in the last homework.

1. It's going to be pretty essential that you map out all the questions you want to ask and what the different functions are going to be. This has a lot of functions all in different places and you'll need to keep track of them all.
